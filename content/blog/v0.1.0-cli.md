Hello,
I have released version 0.1.0 of the GoTables CLI that allows interacting with GoTables servers via the command-line. Currently there is full support for the GT query language and no support for SQL.

Here are the release notes:

- Interact with GT syntax with a GoTables server
- Modify databases and tables with GT syntax
- View command descriptions
