Hello,
I've decided to release version 0.1.0 of the GoTables server as it allows all basic interactions by now. It is still not in a very usable state but all the basic functions are implemented.

Here are the release notes:

- Basic interaction with the GoTables server using the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE http requests
- Create tables (empty or with columns)
- Create databases
- Move/Copy tables
- Move/Copy databases
- Delete tables
- Delete databases
- Show dbs/tables/table (without condition)

[GitLab](https://git.jereileu.ch/gotables/server/gt-server/-/releases/v0.1.0)
[GitHub](https://github.com/GoTables-DB/gt-server/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

As this is my first release in the GoTables project, i will explain where you can find the release and the release notes. In the future i will just include links to [GitLab](https://git.jereileu.ch/gotables) and [GitHub](https://github.com/GoTables-DB).

You can always find the release under "https://git.jereileu.ch/gotables/server/gt-server/-/releases/TAG" and "https://github.com/GoTables-DB/gt-server/releases/tag/TAG" "TAG" = release version tag.
