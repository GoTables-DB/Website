Hello,
in this blog post, I will show you how you can contribute to the GoTables project.

## Issues
If you have any issues with a program distributed as part of the GoTables project, feel free to open an issue on the Gitlab or GitHub page for this program.
For example: the GoTables server exits with an error every time you send a specific request to the server. Then you can create an issue [here](https://git.jereileu.ch/gotables/server/gt-server/-/issues) and describe your problem as detailed as possible.
We will then try to fix your issue.

## Merge requests
If you think a GoTables program is missing a feature that you would like to implement or if you found an issue that you want to fix yourself, you can open a merge request in the repository of the program.

## Financial support
If you would like to support the development of the GoTables project financially, you can do so [here](https://ko-fi.com/jero075). Every donation is deeply appreciated.
